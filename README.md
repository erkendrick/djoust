# Djoust

Djoust is a Unity2D project focused on experimentation to learn game development fundamentals. I intend to release steady updates over the next few months with the simple goal of spending more time building things in Unity. The latest WebGL build can be played at <https://erkendrick.github.io/djoust>. Code from Djoust's origin as a multiplayer game using Node.js and socket.io can be found on the archive branch.

An interesting twist occurred in the initial days of getting comfortable with Unity. While using a rigidbody component on the Player model for handling physics interactions from user inputs, I neglected to modify the default rotation constraints. The resulting mechanic of having to spin to orient your weapon has become a design focus and I want to see where it goes as I continue refining gameplay mechanics. 

## Future Development Ideas

- More bot variety and the addition of bot AI.
    - Chase Bot and Shy Bot are the main ideas to work on right now.
- More environments and additions to existing levels.
    - I want to explore making the game bigger than a single screen arena.
- Explore multiplayer options with user rooms and invite based 1v1 matches.
- Sound effects for collisions and movements, background music.
